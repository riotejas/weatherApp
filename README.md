Project Submission - Weather Service Assignment

Write an HTTP server that serves the current weather. Your server should expose an endpoint that:

1.    Accepts latitude and longitude coordinates

2.    Returns the short forecast for that area for Today (“Partly Cloudy” etc)

3.    Returns a characterization of whether the temperature is “hot”, “cold”, or “moderate” (use your discretion on mapping temperatures to each type)

4.    Use the National Weather Service API Web Service as a data source.

The purpose of this exercise is to provide a sample of your work that we can discuss together in the Technical Interview.

·  We respect your time. Spend as long as you need, but we intend it to take around an hour.

·  We do not expect a production-ready service, but you might want to comment on your shortcuts.

·  The submitted project should build and have brief instructions so we can verify that it works.

·  You may write in whatever language or stack you're most comfortable in, but the technical interviewers are most familiar with Typelevel Scala.
